description: 'Provide the number of equivalent full-time FOIA employees.  This includes employees performing less than full-time FOIA duties that are either: (1) part-time employees who perform FOIA duties all, or part, of the time, or (2) full-time employees who perform FOIA duties less than 100% of the time.   An "equivalent full-time FOIA employee" is created by adding together the percentages of time dedicated to FOIA duties by employees performing less than fulltime FOIA work.  Each time 100% is reached, the time expended is counted as one "equivalent full-time FOIA employee."'
